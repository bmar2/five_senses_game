Notes:

* Unzip and open index.html in your browser. The page loads three.js from a CDN, plays tones via WebAudio, and uses navigator.vibrate when available.

* Smell & Taste rounds are optional and only ask you to use safe, familiar items (water, citrus peel, coffee, soap, etc.). Skip them if you prefer.

* If your browser blocks local file requests for CDN resources, run a simple local server in the folder (for example: python -m http.server) and open http://localhost:8000.
