Five-Senses Game (generated by ChatGPT 5.1) — small WebGL "Five Senses" interactive mini-game that covers the five classic senses

GitHub Page Link: https://bmar2.github.io/five_senses_game/

Files:
- index.html — entry point (includes three.js from CDN)
- script.js — game logic, WebGL scene, and mini-games
- style.css — UI styles
How to play:
1. Unzip and open index.html in your browser.
2. Click an orb to start a mini-game for each sense.
3. Smell and Taste rounds are optional: use safe, familiar items or skip them.

Notes:
- The game uses WebAudio (no external audio files) and navigator.vibrate (optional on some devices).

* Unzip and open index.html in your browser. The page loads three.js from a CDN, plays tones via WebAudio, and uses navigator.vibrate when available.

* Smell & Taste rounds are optional and only ask you to use safe, familiar items (water, citrus peel, coffee, soap, etc.). Skip them if you prefer.

* If your browser blocks local file requests for CDN resources, run a simple local server in the folder (for example: python -m http.server) and open http://localhost:8000.
